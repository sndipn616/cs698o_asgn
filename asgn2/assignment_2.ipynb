    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tywin Lannister was right when he said: \"The great war is between death and life, ice and fire. If we loose, the night will never end\"<br/>\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been six months since the white walkers' army marched into the north, led by the night king himself on a dead dragon. It has been a battle like never before: never before have men faced such an enemy in battle, never before have men fought so bravely against a united threat, and never before have they been so gravely defeated.<br />\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Cersei is in King's landing, brave men have died fighting the great war. Among others, Tyrion is dead, Arya is dead and Jon Snow is dead, again. In a desperate battle, Daenerys leads all her forces in a final stand-off with the dead just south of Winterfell. <br />\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her army defeated, she is now on the run on her dragon in an air battle, being chased by two of her own dragons, the Night king and a dead Jon Snow. Suddenly, the Night king's spear hits Danny's dragon, who, raining blood and fire, falls into ice, taking the lost queen, with him. <br />\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Daenerys opens her eyes in a strange place, a place which does not follow the rules of space and time, where the dead souls killed by the dead men are trapped, forever. But who woke her up? There stands near her, Tyrion, with Jorah, Davos, Jon Snow, and everybody else. They all indulge in a heartfelt reunion when someone yells- \"But how do we get out?<br />\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varys sees a talking crystal close by, who asks them of completing a task, which on completion would allow them to go back to the land of the living, with the ultimate tool to defeat the white-walkers and kills the night king, the Dragon-axe. They have summoned you for help, as the task is out of their expertise, to apply a modified CNN to solve the object detection problem on the PASCAL VOC dataset. Varys, the master of whisperers, has used his talents to import the following for you:"

    "<br/>He also told you that the dataset(datascrolls :P) consists of images from of 20 classes, with detection annotations included. The JPEGImages folder houses the images, and the Annotations folder has the object-wise labels for the objects in one xml file per image. You have to extract the object information, ie. the [xmin, ymin] (the top left x,y co-ordinates) and the [xmax, ymax] (the bottom right x,y co-ordinates) of only the objects belonging to the given 20 classes(aeroplane, bicycle, boat, bottle, bus, car, cat, chair, cow, dining table, dog, horse, motorbike, person, potted plant, sheep, train, TV). For parsing the xml file, you can ask Varys to import xml.etree.ElementTree for you. <br/>\n",
    "<br/> You can then ask Bronn and Jamie to organize the data as follows:\n",
    "<br/> For every image in the dataset, extract/crop the object patch from the image one by one using their respective co-ordinates:[xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax], resize the image to resnet_input, and store it with its class label information. Do the same for training/validation and test datasets. <br/>\n",
    "##### Important\n",
    "You also have to collect data for an extra background class which stands for the class of an object which is not a part of any of the 20 classes. For this, you can crop and resize any random patches from an image. A good idea is to extract patches that have low \"intersection over union\" with any object present in the image frame from the 20 Pascal VOC classes. The number of background images should be roughly around those of other class objects' images. Hence the total classes turn out to be 21. This is important for applying the sliding window method later."

After a fierce battle, Jon Snow manages to go face to face with the Night king. Surrounded by battling men and falling bodies, they engage in a ferocious battle, a battle of spear and axe. After a raging fight, Jon manages to sink the axe into the Night king's heart, but not before he gets wounded by the spear. As dead men fall to bones, Daenerys and others rush to his aid, but it is too late.
